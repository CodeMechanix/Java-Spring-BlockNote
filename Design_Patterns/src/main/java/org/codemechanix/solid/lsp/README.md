The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a
subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. To design classes or functions based on LSP, we can follow
the following guidelines:

1. **Use inheritance to model an "is-a" relationship between classes**. The subclass should be a specialization of the
   superclass and should inherit all its properties and methods.

The methods of the superclass **should be overridden in the subclass only if their behavior is consistent with the
behavior of the superclass**. The overridden method should not change the preconditions, post conditions, or invariants
of
the superclass method.

The methods of the superclass **should accept the same input parameters and return the same output parameters** as the
corresponding methods in the subclass. This ensures that the subclass can be used as a drop-in replacement for the
superclass.

The **exception types thrown by the subclass methods should be the same as, or a subclass of, the exception types thrown
by the corresponding methods in the superclass**. This ensures that the caller of the method is not surprised by
unexpected exceptions.

Here's an example in Java of how to design classes based on LSP:

Suppose we have a superclass called Shape that defines a basic shape with a getArea() method. We want to create a
subclass called Rectangle that inherits from Shape and overrides the getArea() method to compute the area of a
rectangle. Here's the code for the Shape class:

```java
public class Shape {
    public double getArea() {
        return 0.0;
    }
}
```

And here's the code for the Rectangle class:

```java
public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}
```

Notice that the Rectangle class is a subclass of the Shape class and overrides the getArea() method to compute the area
of a rectangle. The Rectangle class inherits the properties and methods of the Shape class and can be used
interchangeably with the Shape class. Here's an example of how to use the Rectangle class:

```java
Shape shape=new Rectangle(10.0,5.0);
        double area=shape.getArea(); // Computes the area of the rectangle
```

In summary, by following the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), we can design software entities that can be used
interchangeably without affecting the correctness of the program. This approach helps to ensure that the software is
flexible and easy to maintain.
