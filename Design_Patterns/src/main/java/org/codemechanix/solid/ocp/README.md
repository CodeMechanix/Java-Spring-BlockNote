The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) is a fundamental design principle in object-oriented programming that states that
software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This
principle aims to ensure that you can extend the behavior of a software entity without modifying its existing code.

In Java, we can apply the OCP by designing classes and interfaces that are open for extension but closed for
modification. Here are some tips on how to apply the OCP in Java:

1. **Use abstraction**: Use abstraction to define the behavior of a software entity. Abstraction allows you to create
   interfaces or abstract classes that define a set of methods that can be implemented by concrete classes. By using
   abstraction, you can make sure that the behavior of a software entity can be extended without modifying its existing
   code.

2. **Use inheritance**: Use inheritance to extend the behavior of a software entity. Inheritance allows you to create a
   new
   class that inherits the behavior of an existing class and then adds or modifies the behavior as needed. By using
   inheritance, you can make sure that the behavior of a software entity can be extended without modifying its existing
   code.
3. **Use composition**: Use composition to create a software entity that is composed of other software entities. By
   using composition, you can create a software entity that has a set of behaviors that can be extended by adding or
   removing the composed entities.

4. **Use dependency injection**: Use dependency injection to provide the required dependencies to a software entity.
   Dependency injection allows you to create a software entity that depends on interfaces or abstract classes, which can
   be implemented by different concrete classes. By using dependency injection, you can make sure that the behavior of a
   software entity can be extended without modifying its existing code.

5. **Write test cases**: Finally, write test cases to verify that the software entity is working correctly. Test cases
   should be designed to test the behavior of the software entity and any extensions that have been added. By doing
   this, you can ensure that the software entity is working as expected and that any changes made to it do not introduce
   bugs or unexpected behavior.

By following these tips, you can design software entities in Java that adhere to the Open-Closed Principle, which can
help to improve code quality, maintainability, and extensibility.

```java
public interface Shape {
    public double calculateArea();
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private double length;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    public double calculateArea() {
        return length * width;
    }
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

public class AreaCalculator {
    private List<Shape> shapes;

    public AreaCalculator(List<Shape> shapes) {
        this.shapes = shapes;
    }

    public double calculateTotalArea() {
        double totalArea = 0.0;
        for (Shape shape : shapes) {
            totalArea += shape.calculateArea();
        }
        return totalArea;
    }
}

```

In this example, we have created an interface called Shape that defines the behavior of a shape that can calculate its
area. We have then created two concrete classes, Rectangle and Circle, that implement the Shape interface and provide
the required functionality based on the interface.

Finally, we have created a class called AreaCalculator that depends on the Shape interface and provides a method called
calculateTotalArea() that can calculate the total area of a list of shapes. This class is open for extension because we
can add new shapes that implement the Shape interface without modifying the existing code.

Another Example,

Suppose we have a class called Logger that is responsible for logging messages to different types of output channels,
such as a file, a console, or a network socket. We want to design this class based on the OCP so that we can easily add
new types of output channels in the future without modifying the existing code.

To do this, we can define an abstract class called OutputChannel that represents a generic output channel. This class
can have an abstract method called write that takes a string message as input and writes it to the output channel.
Here's the code for the OutputChannel class:

```java
public abstract class OutputChannel {
    public abstract void write(String message);
}

```

Next, we can define concrete subclasses of the OutputChannel class for each type of output channel that we want to
support, such as a FileOutputChannel, a ConsoleOutputChannel, and a NetworkOutputChannel. Each of these subclasses
should implement the write method to write the message to their respective output channels. Here's an example of the
FileOutputChannel class:

```java
public class FileOutputChannel extends OutputChannel {
    private String filePath;

    public FileOutputChannel(String filePath) {
        this.filePath = filePath;
    }

    @Override
    public void write(String message) {
        // Write the message to a file
    }
}

```

Finally, we can modify the Logger class to depend on the OutputChannel abstract class instead of specific output channel
implementations. This way, we can easily add new output channels without modifying the existing code. Here's an example
of the modified Logger class:

```java
public class Logger {
    private OutputChannel outputChannel;

    public Logger(OutputChannel outputChannel) {
        this.outputChannel = outputChannel;
    }

    public void log(String message) {
        outputChannel.write(message);
    }
}
```

Now, we can create a new instance of the Logger class with a specific output channel, such as a file output channel, and
use it to log messages without worrying about the specific implementation details of the output channel. Here's an
example of how to use the Logger class with a FileOutputChannel:

```java
OutputChannel fileOutputChannel=new FileOutputChannel("log.txt");
Logger logger=new Logger(fileOutputChannel);
logger.log("Hello, world!");

```

In summary, by defining an abstract class that represents a generic behavior, creating concrete subclasses that
implement that behavior, and modifying the main class to depend on the abstract class, we can design software entities
that adhere to the Open-Closed Principle (OCP). This approach allows us to add new behaviors or functionality without
modifying the existing code.
